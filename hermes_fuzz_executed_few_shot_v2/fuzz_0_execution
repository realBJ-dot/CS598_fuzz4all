## Native code - JS to native

At this point it is likely that your RN code will run on the native platform. However, for our application purposes Hermes runs the code from a JS runtime. This code then runs on the native platform.

This document describes using Hermes to run from RN. If you only plan to use Hermes on Android, then there is some more detailed documentation for that [here](react-native-hermes-setup.md).
