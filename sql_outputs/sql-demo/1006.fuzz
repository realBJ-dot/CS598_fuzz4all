-- MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that allows users to create, modify and extract data from a structured relational database using the Structured Query Language (SQL). It works harmoniously with an operating system to structure and manage a relational database, control user access, and execute other tasks like network access and testing database integrity.
