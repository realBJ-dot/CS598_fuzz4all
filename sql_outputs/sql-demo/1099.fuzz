CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS sampleDB; USE sampleDB;
-- CREATE TABLE is used in almost the same way as INSERT. You have to pass the table name first before the rest of INSERT query.
insert into table1 values(1, 9, '20 February, 1983');
insert into table1 values(2, 10, '01 January, 1980');
insert into table1 values(3, 9, '01 February, 1985');
-- The order of table column names does not matter. If the columns were not in a natural order, it may affect a result.
-- INSERT statement does not return the inserted values, but rather the rows affected.
