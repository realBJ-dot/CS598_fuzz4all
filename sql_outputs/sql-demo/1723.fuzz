CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS sampleDB; USE sampleDB;
DROP table user
-- For MySQL, you can use a command like this in the terminal to generate a sequence of keys (i.e., primary keys) for a new table. This is a sequence in the actual database that can be used for other tables to reference.
ALTER TABLE user AUTO_INCREMENT = 3;
SELECT * from user;
# Output should be like:  (empty for the mutated user table)
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS sampleDB;
SELECT * from user;
