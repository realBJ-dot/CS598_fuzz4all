-- MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) named after co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter My and SQL, the acronym for Structured Query Language. As an RDBMS, MySQL helps organize data into tables that can be interrelated, facilitating data management. It works with operating systems to implement a relational database in a computer's storage system, managing users, network access, and database integrity testing and backup creation.

Under the GNU General Public License, MySQL is available for free, but it also comes under various proprietary licenses. The software was originally owned by the Swedish company MySQL AB, and later came under the ownership of Sun Microsystems, which is now Oracle Corporation. In 2010, the open-source MySQL project was forked to create MariaDB.

MySQL can interact directly with a MySQL database using SQL. However, it's more commonly used with other programs implementing applications requiring relational database capabilities. It forms a crucial part of several web application software stacks like LAMP and is extensively used by many database-driven web applications and popular websites.

Crafted in C and C++, MySQL operates on various system platforms. Its distribution involves dual-licensing - under GPL version 2 or a proprietary license. For support, it has an official manual, numerous IRC channels and forums, and Oracle also offers paid support through its MySQL Enterprise products.

MySQL has received positive reviews for its performance, developer interfaces, and robust documentation. It has been established as a fast, stable, and authentic multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server.
/* Please create a very short query which uses SQL features in a complex way. Be sure to use ENGINE=InnoDB. You should only use sampleDB as the database and assume no other table exist. You need to create new tables to perform operations. In the end, drop all tables you created. */
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS sampleDB; USE sampleDB;
