-- MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) named after co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter "My", and "SQL" which stands for Structured Query Language. It is mainly used to create, modify, and extract data from the relational database, as well as to control user access to the database, working alongside an operating system to facilitate tasks such as network access, user management, testing database integrity, and backup creation. 

MySQL operates under the GNU General Public License and can also be used under various proprietary licenses. It used to be owned by Swedish company MySQL AB until it was bought by Sun Microsystems, which is now owned by Oracle Corporation. The software was later forked by Widenius to create MariaDB when Oracle took over Sun. 

MySQL acts as a standalone client allowing users to interact directly with its database. Nevertheless, it is often used with other software to implement applications necessitating relational database capability. It is part of the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python) web application software stack and is used by many popular websites and database-driven web applications.

Written in C and C++, MySQL operates on many system platforms. It uses dual-licensing distribution: GPL version 2 or a proprietary license. Support can be obtained from the official manual, IRC channels, forums, and paid support from Oracle via MySQL Enterprise products. The software has received positive reviews for its speed, stability, and efficient multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server capabilities.

/* Please create a very short query which uses SQL features in a complex way. Be sure to use ENGINE=InnoDB. You should only use sampleDB as the database and assume no other table exist. You need to create new tables to perform operations. In the end, drop all tables you created. */
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS sampleDB; USE sampleDB;
